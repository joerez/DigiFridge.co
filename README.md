# DigiFridge
DigiFridge is the ultimate hipster hub for keeping track of things and communicating with co-workers.

## Personal Fridges
This is your personal fridge. Have fun with it, and send magnets to your FridgeFriends to communicate back and forth. You can create magnets for your fridge, and you can also click and drag them around your fridge. Send magnets to community fridges you are a part of.

## Community Fridges
This fridge is accessable by everyone in a user created community. Perfect for co-workers and teams to share a fridge. Communities can send magnets to personal fridges of team members and other community fridges that choose to associate with each other.

## The Mother Fridge
This is accessible by everyone. It is the mother of all fridges. Everyone can put things on the mother fridge. Everyone can take things out of the mother fridge. The mother fridge is cleaned out regularly. 

## How To Use
Bob says to Bill, "Hey Bill, when you get back from Lunch can you swing by my desk?" Bob says to Bill, "Sure, put that on my Fridge so I'll remember about it when I get back." Bill says "Sure thing Bob."
